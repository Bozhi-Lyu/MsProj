# Topic 1: 3D Reconstruction

## Optimal Goals:
- 3d Reconstruction by two cameras.
- Detection, tracking of human interaction from the reconstructed models.

## Prerequisite:
- Basic knowledge on Quaternions and spatial rotation, etc.

## Steps: 
### Fundamental knowledge on camera models
- pin-hole models [Literature: multiview geometry in computer vision](https://www.r-5.org/files/books/computers/algo-list/image-processing/vision/Richard_Hartley_Andrew_Zisserman-Multiple_View_Geometry_in_Computer_Vision-EN.pdf ) ch 6.1
- lens distortion models
- unreal engine camera models (internal reports)
